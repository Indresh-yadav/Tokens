# MyToken Smart Contract

# Overview
This Solidity smart contract, named MyToken, facilitates the creation and management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for token minting and burning functionalities, enabling the expansion and reduction of token supply within the specified parameters.

# Features
Token Minting: Users can create new tokens by calling the mint function, specifying the address to receive the tokens and the quantity to be minted.

Token Burning: Token holders can reduce the total token supply by burning tokens using the burn function. This function decreases the balance of the specified address and adjusts the total supply accordingly.

# Getting Started

-To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

-Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:
-To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

-Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

-Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by giving the address and value and then calling the function mint, burn , balances.

# Usage
-Deploy the MyToken contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
-Utilize the mint function to create new tokens, specifying the recipient's address and the desired quantity.
-Token holders can burn tokens using the burn function, reducing the total token supply.
-Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or through other smart contracts.
