# MyToken Smart Contract
# Overview
This Solidity smart contract, named MyToken, facilitates the creation and management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for token minting and burning functionalities, enabling the expansion and reduction of token supply within the specified parameters.

# Features
Token Minting: Users can create new tokens by calling the mint function, specifying the address to receive the tokens and the quantity to be minted.

Token Burning: Token holders can reduce the total token supply by burning tokens using the burn function. This function decreases the balance of the specified address and adjusts the total supply accordingly.

# Usage
Deploy the MyToken contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Utilize the mint function to create new tokens, specifying the recipient's address and the desired quantity.
Token holders can burn tokens using the burn function, reducing the total token supply.
Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or through other smart contracts.
